Project for FER subject "Text Analysis and Retrieval" (https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/course/taar)<br>

16. Event extraction: The Whodunit of Structured Text<br>
Event extraction encompasses the process of identifying and extracting organized details
regarding events from textual data. It encompasses various tasks such as recognizing and
categorizing events, event triggers, and associated arguments. Your objective is to make
use of datasets tailored for event extraction to identify events, triggers, and/or arguments.<br>
